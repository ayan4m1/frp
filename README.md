# Gradio Share Server (FRP)

This repo is a fork of the [Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP)](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) implementation that is running on Gradio's Share to create Gradio's [Share links](https://www.gradio.app/guides/sharing-your-app#sharing-demos).

We've open-sourced it so that you can run your own Gradio
